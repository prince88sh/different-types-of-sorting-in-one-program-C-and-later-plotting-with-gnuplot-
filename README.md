# different-types-of-sorting-in-one-program-C++-and-later-plotting-with-gnuplot-
in this  Repository it contains list of sorting in one program made using OPP and file handling concept and later plotting using  'gnuplot'

##inorder to implement the code
1>  run the sorting.cpp in complier using code editor like codeblocks,devc++,vs code(recommended)
2>  you can run for one functions one at a time to get proper visulization of code
                                                  sample is attach in the Repository as sample_img.png
3>if you want to see the graph of sorting(e.g . bubble sort) then either run gnu.cpp to see output as graph
                                            OR
3> see the 'gnuplot_sampletorun.png' to do implementation   (refer to yoyutube videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QUtcfyBFhE&list=PLaYBfUc8SG7W4cTZprVWjbtwrottWuk8c&index=1&ab_channel=MathAndPhysics)

4>later try to compare with other sorting algo
